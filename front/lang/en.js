        Reclaim control of your data and hide from prying eyes.With Dcomms you can communicate safely even when connections are being surveilled, or when the Internet is disconnected.Dcomms will never sell your data or hand your information over to the authorities.We run a free and open - source software stack with a focus on open, decentralized, and federated technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dcomms was initially launched by eQualit.ie in 2022 in response to full scaled Russia invasion of Ukraine.Eventually, it became its own project within eQualitie.At the start, the goal was to deploy many instances of encrypted chat services across Ukraine in preparation for the possibility that cities could be completely disconnected from the wider Internet.
      <p>
        This goal changed slightly when occupied cities’ connections were being routed through Russia, meaning security and privacy needed to be prioritized.Additionally, rather than long - term disconnections, we saw only short - term cut - offs in cities where shelling hit the Internet fiber - optic cables, so our offering needed to support users in those short time spans.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Dcomms grows we hope to add many more free and open - source services useful to those who need them.If there is something you’ d like us to add, please make an issue over on our Github page.https: //github.com/censorship-no/dcomms
      </p>`

If you are on located on the temporarily occupied territories, then this simple preparation guarantees you having communication channels that work regardless connectivity issues. We have created several servers on the territory of Ukraine to ensure the possibility of communication between users over the local network, regardless of what is happening. The list of these applications will be updated.",
