      <h2>Project objective </h2>
      <p>
        The goal of the project is to create an alternative communication platform for regular Internet users in case ofInternet access restriction or censorship.We offer a list of various applications that allow communicating through an open and free protocol, hosted on local networks in Ukraine.In other words, we offer you to download the applications, configure, and try how it works, so that censorship restrictions and/or Internet shutdowns will not pose a problem for you.
      </p>
      <h2>How it works?</h2>
      <p>All these instructions are provided to make a point that simple actions can ensure communication with each other, with friends and relatives abroad, as well as access to the international information field, in case the usual methods of communication would stop working. To do this, one can download these applications and connect to the servers that one can trust.</p>
      <p>
        <b>There are two key concepts: decentralization and federalism.</b> What does it mean? For non-tech people, we suggest testing the applications that do not have a single server that manages their work like do popular applications (Viber, Telegram, Whatsapp, Facebook Messenger, etc.) Therefore, proposed applications cannot be disabled by simple turning off the switches on the main server.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Note.</b> Your family and friends who you would like to keep in touch in case of Internet shutdown would also need to install the same programs. However, since you can host a local server on your local hosting, the server settings can also be managed. We propose you the tools that are only a small part of the Fediverse, which is a union of decentralized services that work according to the principle of federation. Once a user has an account on one of the services, it allows interaction with others without additional registration on each of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, the owner of the server CANNOT access the information in private chats he is not a part of. The server owner’s access to information is limited by public chats only.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, the website offers several applications from the vast decentralized universe. This list will gradually expand. The programs are hosted on the servers hosted in Ukrainian data centers. If you have access to one of them, you can communicate with each other even if your area does not have the internet connection required to use other popular messengers.
      </p>
      <h2>Why is this necessary?</h2>
      <p>
        We understand that the main channels of communication in the temporarily occupied territories are currently controlled by the occupant government, while the access to information and communication with the world is a necessary resource. In dictatorship limiting this resource is an easy target. Thus, we propose you to get prepared in advance. The tools we offer give you an opportunity to provide yourself with an alternative in communication channels in the worst case scenario.
      </p>`

      content: `<h2>What is Briar?</h2>
      <p>
        Briar is a messaging app designed for activists, journalists, and anyone
        else who needs a safe, easy and robust way to communicate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike traditional messaging apps, Briar doesn’t rely on a central
        server - messages are synchronized directly between the users' devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the internet’s down, Briar can sync via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, keeping
        the information flowing in a crisis. If the internet’s up, Briar can
        sync via the Tor network, protecting users and their relationships from
        surveillance.
      </p>

      <dev><img src="/docs/briar/img/briar.png" width="100%" /></dev>

      <h2>Creating an Account</h2>
      <p>
        When you open the Briar app for the first time you'll be asked to create
        an account. Your account will be stored securely on your device,
        encrypted with your password.
      </p>
      <p>
        Choose your nickname carefully as you can't change it later. You can
        choose the same nickname as someone else, just like in real life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Choose a password that's hard to guess but easy to remember. If you
        forget your password we can't help you regain access to your account.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you need to delete your account in a hurry, just uninstall the Briar
        app.
      </p>

      <h2>Battery Settings</h2>
      <p>
        After choosing your nickname and password, Briar will ask for permission
        to disable battery optimizations so it can run in the background. This
        is necessary because there's no server to receive messages on your
        behalf while Briar is in the background: Briar needs to receive those
        messages itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Huawei and Xiaomi devices you'll be asked to take extra steps to let
        Briar run in the background. Please follow the instructions carefully.
      </p>

      <h2>Adding a Contact</h2>
      <p>
        After creating your account you'll see an empty contact list. To add a
        contact, press the plus button (+). There are two options, depending on
        whether the person you want to add is nearby.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the person you want to add is nearby, choose "Add contact nearby". If
        the person you want to add is not nearby and you have Internet access,
        choose "Add contact at a distance".
      </p>

      <h2>Adding a Contact Nearby</h2>
      <p>
        When you choose "Add contact nearby", Briar will ask for permission to
        use your camera so it can scan your contact's QR code. Briar will also
        ask for permission to access your location so it can connect to your
        contact via Bluetooth. Briar doesn't store, share, or upload your
        location, but this permission is needed for discovering nearby Bluetooth
        devices. Finally, Briar will ask for permission to turn on Bluetooth and
        make your device visible to nearby Bluetooth devices for a short time.
      </p>
      <p>
        After granting all these permissions, Briar will show a QR code and a
        camera viewfinder. Scan your contact's QR code and let them scan yours.
        After about 30 seconds your devices should connect to each other and
        your contact should be added to your contact list.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your devices fail to connect to each other, both of you should go
        back to the contact list and start the process again.
      </p>

      <h2>Adding a Contact at a Distance</h2>
      <p>
        When you choose "Add contact at a distance", Briar will show a link that
        needs to be sent to the person you want to add. You can send the link
        via another app such as Signal. Your contact also needs to send you
        their link. Paste your contact's link and choose a nickname for them. If
        you and your contact are both signed into Briar and both have Internet
        access then your contact should be added to your contact list within a
        few minutes.
      </p>

      <h2>Send a Message</h2>
      <p>
        After adding your first contact, tap their name in the contact list to
        send your first message. The circle next to your contact's name will be
        green when Briar is connected to your contact via Internet, Wi-Fi or
        Bluetooth.
      </p>

      <h2>Introduce Your Contacts</h2>
      <p>
        You can use the introduction feature to introduce your contacts to each
        other so they don't have to meet up in person to add each other.
      </p>

      <h2>Write a blog post</h2>
      <p>
        You can use the blog feature to write posts that all your contacts can
        see. You can also reblog other people's posts to let all your contacts
        see them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bear in mind that you can't delete blog posts after they've been sent.
      </p>

      <h2>Create a forum</h2>
      <p>
        You can use the forum feature to create group discussions and invite
        your contacts to join. Anyone who belongs to a forum can invite their
        own contacts to join.
      </p>

      <h2>Tips for offline communication</h2>
      <p>
        The range of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi is around 10 metres, depending on
        obstacles. Clearly this isn't enough for communicating across a city or
        even a large building. So when Briar receives a message from a nearby
        contact, it stores the message and can later pass it on to other
        contacts when they come within range (for example, when you move from
        one place to another).
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that Briar will only synchronize messages with your
        contacts, not with nearby strangers who are running Briar. And it will
        only sync the messages you've chosen to share with each contact. For
        example, if you invite your contacts X and Y to join a forum, and they
        accept, then messages in that forum will be synced with X or Y whenever
        they're within range. So you can receive forum messages from X in one
        location, travel to another location, and deliver those messages to Y.
      </p>
      <p>
        But this doesn't work for private messages: they're only synchronized
        directly between the sender and recipient.
      </p>
      <p>
        A forum is a good way for a group of people to keep in touch without
        Internet access. To make sure that forum posts are synced between all
        members of the forum, introduce all the members so they become contacts,
        and make sure that everyone invites everyone else to the forum and
        accepts the invitations, even if they already belong to the forum. This
        will ensure that whenever two members are within Bluetooth or Wi-Fi
        range they synchronize all the forum messages they've received.
      </p>
      <p>
        If lots of people within Wi-Fi range want to communicate, it can be
        useful to create a Wi-Fi hotspot on one person's phone. Even if the
        hotspot doesn't have Internet access, Briar can use it to communicate
        with contacts who are connected to the same hotspot.
      </p>
      <p>
        If it's too risky to carry your phone from place to place (eg
        checkpoints), you can sync encrypted messages using a USB stick or SD
        card to carry them more discreetly.
