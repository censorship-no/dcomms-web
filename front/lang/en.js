        Reclaim control of your data and hide from prying eyes. With dComms, you can communicate safely even when connections are being surveilled, or when the Internet is disconnected. dComms will never sell your data or hand your information over to the authorities. We run a free and open source software stack with a focus on open, decentralized, and federated technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        dComms was initially launched by eQualit.ie in 2022 in rapid response to the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. The initial goal was to deploy many instances of encrypted communication services across Ukraine to prepare for the possibility of cities becoming completely disconnected from the wider Internet.
      <p>
        This goal shifted slightly when occupied cities’ connections were becoming routed through Russia, meaning security and privacy needed to be prioritized. Additionally, rather than long-term disconnections, we saw only short-term cut-offs in cities where shelling hit the Internet fiber-optic cables, so our offering needed to support users in those short time spans.
      </p>
      <p>
        As dComms grows we hope to add many more free and open source services useful to those who need them. If there is something you’d like us to add, please make create issue on our Github page: https://github.com/censorship-no/dcomms
      </p>`

If you are located in a temporarily-occupied territory, then this simple preparation ensures some backup communication channels that will work regardless of connectivity issues. We maintain several servers across Ukraine to ensure the possibility of communication between users over local networks, regardless of what is happening. The list of these applications will be updated in response to users' needs. We welcome and encourage feedback and participation!",
